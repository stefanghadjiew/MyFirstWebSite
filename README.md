e-commerce website for wrist watches.First personal big project with main focus on HTML and CSS(SCSS) with some Javascript.It has fully functional user authorization and authentication along with a very simple cart(Node JS + MongoDB on the backend).Browsing as "guest" functionality is still not finished(will be soon),so i suggest to just create an account if you like to check it out :).Biggest challenge by far was creating userAuth and connecting it with cart,but it was alot of fun for me.I still have a problem where the site sends a cookie when we hit the landing page,and it SHOULD send one only after we log-in.
